This code contains the entire repository of the code used to transmit, jam, and receive jammed CIFAR10 images from for a two-step deep learning approach to Inteference Mitigation on an Orin Jetsen. It contains a RF Denoising stage comprised of a Wavenet and UNet Transformer, followed by a image denosing UNet.

UNet Transformer Background:
UNet Transformer for RF Denoising based off RF Challenge Wavenet. The initial inspiration for this project is based off the co-channel mitigation challenge from the MIT RF Challenge. A link to the initial code can be seen below:
https://rfchallenge.mit.edu/icassp24-single-channel/

The Current UNet Trasnformer was also based on a earlier design below: https://github.com/JohnCimm/Co-Channel-Mitigation-UNet-Transformer
This UNet Transformer Was Designed for a University of Utah Senior Design Clinic in the Electrical Engineering Department Sponsored by L3Harris.
